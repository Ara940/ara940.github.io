excerpt: While deep learning has shown tremendous success in a wide range of domains, it remains a grand challenge to incorporate physical principles in a systematic manner to the design, training, and inference of such models. In this paper, we aim to predict turbulent flow by learning its highly nonlinear dynamics from spatiotemporal velocity fields of large-scale fluid flow simulations of relevance to turbulence modeling and climate modeling. We adopt a hybrid approach by marrying two well-established turbulent flow simulation techniques with deep learning. Specifically, we introduce trainable spectral filters in a coupled model of Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) and Large Eddy Simulation (LES), followed by a specialized U-net for prediction. Our approach, which we call turbulent-Flow Net (TF-Net), is grounded in a principled physics model, yet offers the flexibility of learned representations. We compare our model, TF-Net, with state-of-the-art baselines and observe significant reductions in error for predictions 60 frames ahead. Most importantly, our method predicts physical fields that obey desirable physical characteristics, such as conservation of mass, whilst faithfully emulating the turbulent kinetic energy field and spectrum, which are critical for accurate prediction of turbulent flows.

### Prediction Visualization
We propose a novel hybrid model for turbulence prediction, $\texttt{TF-Net}$, that unifies a popular CFD technique, RANS-LES coupling, with custom-designed U-net. The following two videos show the ground truth and the predicted U and V velocity fields from $\texttt{TF-Net}$ and three best baselines.

### Introduction
Modeling the spatiotemporal dynamics over a wide range of space and time scales is a fundamental task in science, especially atmospheric science, marine science and aerodynamics. [Computational fluid dynamics (CFD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_fluid_dynamics) is at the heart of climate modeling and has direct implications for understanding and predicting climate change.  Recently, deep learning have demonstrated great success in the [automation, acceleration, and streamlining of highly compute-intensive workflows for science](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-0912-1). We hope deep learning can accelerate the turbulence simulation since the current CFD is purely physics-based and computationally-intensive, requiring significant computational resources and expertise.

But existing deep learning methods are mainly statistical with no underlying physical knowledge incorporated, and are yet to be proven to be successful in capturing and predicting accurately the complex physical systems. Thus, developing deep learning methods that can incorporate physical laws in a systematic manner is a key element in advancing AI for physical sciences.

### Turbulent-Flow Net
[Computational techniques](https://uknowledge.uky.edu/me_textbooks/2/) are at the core of present-day turbulence investigations. Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) are accurate but not computationally feasible for practical applications. Great emphasis was placed on the alternative approaches including Large-Eddy Simulation (LES), Reynolds-averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) as well as [Hybrid RANS-LES Coupling](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10494-017-9828-8) that combines both RANS and LES approaches in order to take advantage of both methods. 

Hybrid RANS-LES Coupling decomposes the flow variables into three parts: mean flow, resolved fluctuations and unresolved (subgrid) fluctuations. It applies the spatial filtering operator $S$ and the temporal average operator $T$ sequentially. 

$$\pmb{w^*}(\pmb{x},t) = S \ast\pmb{w}  = \sum_{\pmb{\xi}} S(\pmb{x}|\pmb{\xi})\pmb{w}(\pmb{\xi},t)$$

$$\pmb{\bar{w}}(\pmb{x},t) = T \ast \pmb{w^*} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{s = t-n}^tT(s) \pmb{w^*} (\pmb{x}, s)$$  


then $\pmb{\tilde{w}}$ can be defined as the difference between $\pmb{w^*}$ and $\pmb{\bar{w}}$:

$$\pmb{\tilde{w}} = \pmb{w^*} - \pmb{\bar{w}}, \quad \pmb{w'} = \pmb{w} - \pmb{w^{*}}$$


Finally we can have the three-level decomposition of the velocity field.

\begin{equation}
\pmb{w} = \pmb{\bar{w}} + \pmb{\tilde{w}} + \pmb{w'}
\end{equation}

Inspired by the hybrid RANS-LES Coupling, we propose a hybrid deep learning framework, $\texttt{TF-Net}$, based on the multilevel spectral decomposition. Specifically, we decompose the velocity field into three scales using the spatial filter $S$ and the temporal filter $T$. Unlike traditional CFD, both filters in $\texttt{TF-Net}$ are trainable neural networks. The motivation for this design is to explicitly guide the DL model to learn the non-linear dynamics of both large and small eddies. We design three identical encoders to encode the three scale components separately and use a shared decoder to learn the interactions among these three components and generate the final prediction. The figure  below shows the overall architecture of our hybrid model $\texttt{TF-Net}$.

### Results
We compare our model with six baselines. The following two figures show the growth of RMSE and the averages of absolute divergence with prediction horizon up to 60 time steps ahead. We can see that $\texttt{TF-Net}$ consistently outperforms all baselines, and constraining it with divergence free regularizer can further improve the performance.

From the energy spectrum curve in the left figure below, we can see that $\texttt{TF-net}$ predictions are in fact much closer to the target. By Incorporating physics principles, $\texttt{TF-Net}$ is able to generate predictions that are physically consistent with the ground truth. The right figure below shows the average time to produce one 64 Ã— 448 2d velocity field for all models on single V100 GPU. We can see that $\texttt{TF-net}$, $\texttt{U_net}$ and $\texttt{GAN}$ are faster than the numerical Lattice Boltzmann method. It will show greater advantage of speed on higher resolution data.

We also perform an additional ablation study of TF-Net to understand each component of $\texttt{TF-Net}$ and investigate whether the model has actually learned the flow with different scales. During inference, we applied each small U-net in $\texttt{TF-Net}$ with the other two encoders removed to the entire input domain. The video below includes $\texttt{TF-Net}$ predictions and the outputs of each small $\texttt{U-net}$ while the other two encoders are zeroed out. We observe that the outputs of each small $\texttt{U-net}$ are the flow with different scales, which demonstrates that $\texttt{TF-Net}$ can learn multi-scale behaviors.
