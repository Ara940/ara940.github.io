### Overview
The UCSD ML blog is a forum for students, postdocs, and faculty from the greater UCSD community to share their exciting work and ideas. The majority of the content focuses on the intersection of theoretical and practical advances in machine learning, data science, and applied algorithms. The typical post will either be a technical (yet accessible) introduction to a recent research paper or a gentle exposition of an important technique in the area. We aim to release new posts approximately every week or two.
